basics in vector representation, position vectors, and vector projection.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      As review, projections of a force onto any certain line can be easily found once a force is already represented as a vector. In problem 137, the\n      components of <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}$\" /> that act along rod AC and perpendicular to it must be found. The Force vector can be found\n      using the given magnitude and given information that the force acts in the same direction as a vector from B to D. For the projection of the\n      Force vector onto the rod AC, the component can be found using the dot product between the force vector and the unit vector along the desired\n      projection direction. Alternatively, cosine may be used if the angle between BD and AC is known.\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"text-center\">\n      <p><vue-mathjax formula=\"$F_{||} = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{u_{AC}} = |\\vec{F}|\\cos \\theta$\" /></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The component of the perpendicular force may be found using the following relation</p>\n    <div class=\"text-center\">\n      <p><vue-mathjax formula=\"$F^2 = F_{\\perp}^2 + F_{||}^2$\" /></p>\n    </div>\n    <fp />\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport force_projection from \"../../utils/ForceProj/force_proj_rod.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {};\n  },\n  components: {\n    fp: force_projection\n  }\n};\nexport const meta = {\n  title: \"Force Vector Projection\",\n  description: \"\",\n  number: 6\n};\n</script>\n\n<style>\np {\n  font-size: 16;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ForceProjectionRod.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ForceProjectionRod.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./ForceProjectionRod.vue?vue&type=template&id=11d07f52&\"\nimport script from \"./ForceProjectionRod.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./ForceProjectionRod.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./ForceProjectionRod.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"container-fluid\"},[_c('h1',{staticClass:\"text-danger text-center my-4\"},[_vm._v(\"Force Projection onto a Line\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"\\n    Once we get a force, including its direction and magnitude, we can know its projection on a certain given line.

formula=\"$\\vec{F}$\" /> about point O, or actually about the moment axis passing through O and perpendicular\n      to the plane containing O and <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}$\" />, can be expressed using the vector cross product, namely\n      <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{M}_O = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}$\" />. Here <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{r}$\" /> represents a position vector directed\n      from O to any point on the line of action of <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}$\" />.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For a beam with unbalanced moment <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{M}_O$\" />, the equation of motion is described by\n      <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{M}_O = I_O \\vec{\\ddot{\\theta}}$\" />, where <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{\\ddot{\\theta}}$\" /> is the angular\n      acceleration, <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{I_O}$\" /> is the moment of inertia with respect to O. If the beam is constrained to be rotate within\n      certain plane, the equation of motion is simplified as <vue-mathjax formula=\"$M_O = I_0 \\ddot{\\theta}$\" />. So we see, in order to keep the beam\n      in static, we need to make the <vue-mathjax formula=\"$M_O$\" /> to zero.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For the following problem, we have two forces <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}_1$\" />,<vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}_2$\" />, with their\n      magnitudes, directions and acting positions to be set. Both of them produce the moment with respect to hinge, and the resultant may cause the\n      moment to rotate with respect to hinge. We can see the rotation once we set unbalanced moment of these two forces. Also, we can see that the\n      beam will keep in static once the resultant moment is zero.\n    </p>\n\n    <!-- <div class=\"text-center\">\n      <p><vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{r}$\" /></p>\n    </div> -->\n    <mf />\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport moment_of_force from \"../../utils/MomentOfForce/moment_of_force_2D.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {};\n  },\n  components: {\n    mf: moment_of_force\n  }\n};\nexport const meta = {\n  title: \"Moment of Force 2D\",\n  description: \"\",\n  number: 9\n};\n</script>\n\n<style>\np {\n  font-size: 16;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./MomentForce2D.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\";

class=\"text-danger text-center my-4\">Method of Sections</h1>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col\">\n        <p>\n          When we need to find the force in only a few members of a truss, we can analyze the truss using the method of sections. It is based on the\n          principle that if the truss is in equilibrium then any segment of the truss is also in equilibrium. Since we only have three independent\n          equilibrium equations, i.e. 2 force components equilibrium + 1 moment equilibrium, or 1 force components equilibrium + 2 moment equilibrium,\n          we should try to choose section passes that cut through no more than 3 members. Always assume that the unknown member forces at the cut\n          section are tensile forces, i.e., \"pulling\" on the member. By doing this, the numerical solution of the equilibrium equations will yield\n          positive scalars for members in tension and negative scalars for members in compression.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We pick an example from Chapter 6.4 of Hibbler's Mechanics of Materials, 10th edition to show the process in detail. During the solution, we\n          should carefully consider ways of writing the equations so as to yield a direct solution for each of the unknowns, rather than having to\n          solve simultaneous equations. So, in this example, we first sum moments about G to yield a direct solution for F<sub>BC</sub>, since F<sub\n            >GC</sub\n          >\n          and F<sub>GF</sub> create zero moment about G. Then F<sub>GC</sub> can be found directly by the force summation in y direction since F<sub\n            >BC</sub\n          >\n          and F<sub>GF</sub> have no components in y direction. Finally, by summing moments about C we get F<sub>GF</sub> directly since F<sub\n            >BC</sub\n          >\n          and F<sub>GC</sub>\n          create zero moment about C.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Such Method of Sections is very quick. As a comparison, if the method of joints were used to determine, say, the force in member GC, it\n          would be necessary to analyze joints A, B, and G in sequence, which is more tedious.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col\">\n        <div class=\"row align-items-center\">\n          <div class=\"col\">\n            <button class=\"btn btn-primary mx-3\" :class=\"{ 'btn-warning': currentSelection === 0 }\" @click=\"() => changeSelection(0)\">\n              Overview\n            </button>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"col\">\n            <button class=\"btn btn-primary mx-3\" :class=\"{ 'btn-warning': currentSelection === 1 }\" @click=\"() => changeSelection(1)\">Section</button>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"col\">\n            <button class=\"btn btn-primary mx-3\" :class=\"{ 'btn-warning': currentSelection === 2 }\" @click=\"() => changeSelection(2)\">\n              F<sub>BC</sub>\n            </button>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"col\">\n            <button class=\"btn btn-primary mx-3\" :class=\"{ 'btn-warning': currentSelection === 3 }\" @click=\"() => changeSelection(3)\">\n              F<sub>GC</sub>\n            </button>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"col\">\n            <button class=\"btn btn-primary mx-3\" :class=\"{ 'btn-warning': currentSelection === 4 }\" @click=\"() => changeSelection(4)\">\n              F<sub>GF</sub>\n            </button>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"row\">\n          <methOfSec ref=\"foo\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n//import truss from \"../../utils/methods_of_sections/truss\";\n//import cutSections from \"../../utils/methods_of_sections/cutSections\";\n//import Fbc from \"../../utils/methods_of_sections/Fbc\";\n//import Fgc from \"../../utils/methods_of_sections/Fgc\";\n//import Fgf from \"../../utils/methods_of_sections/Fgf\";\nimport meth_of_sec from \"../../utils/methods_of_sections/meth_of_sec\";\n\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return { currentSelection: 0 };\n  },\n  components: {\n    methOfSec: meth_of_sec\n    //truss: truss,\n    //cutSections: cutSections,\n    //Fbc: Fbc,\n    //Fgc: Fgc,\n    //Fgf: Fgf\n  },\n  methods: {\n    changeSelection(nextState) {\n      this.currentSelection = nextState;\n      this.$refs.foo.change_state(nextState);\n      console.log(nextState);\n    }\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    // let c1 = document.querySelector(\".column1\");\n    // let c2 = document.querySelector(\".column2\");\n    // let p = c2.parentElement;\n    // c1.clientWidth = p.clientWidth - c2.clientWidth;\n  }\n};\nexport const meta = {\n  title: \"Methods of sections\",\n  description: \"\",\n  number: 22\n};\n</script>\n\n<style>\np {\n  font-size: 16;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./methods_of_sections.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\";
