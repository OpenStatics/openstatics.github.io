class=\"text-danger text-center my-4\">Method of Sections</h1>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col\">\n        <p>\n          When we need to find the force in only a few members of a truss, we can analyze the truss using the method of sections. It is based on the\n          principle that if the truss is in equilibrium then any segment of the truss is also in equilibrium. Since we only have three independent\n          equilibrium equations, i.e. 2 force components equilibrium + 1 moment equilibrium, or 1 force components equilibrium + 2 moment equilibrium,\n          we should try to choose section passes that cut through no more than 3 members. Always assume that the unknown member forces at the cut\n          section are tensile forces, i.e., \"pulling\" on the member. By doing this, the numerical solution of the equilibrium equations will yield\n          positive scalars for members in tension and negative scalars for members in compression.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We pick an example from Chapter 6.4 of Hibbler's Mechanics of Materials, 10th edition to show the process in detail. During the solution, we\n          should carefully consider ways of writing the equations so as to yield a direct solution for each of the unknowns, rather than having to\n          solve simultaneous equations. So, in this example, we first sum moments about G to yield a direct solution for F<sub>BC</sub>, since F<sub\n            >GC</sub\n          >\n          and F<sub>GF</sub> create zero moment about G. Then F<sub>GC</sub> can be found directly by the force summation in y direction since F<sub\n            >BC</sub\n          >\n          and F<sub>GF</sub> have no components in y direction. Finally, by summing moments about C we get F<sub>GF</sub> directly since F<sub\n            >BC</sub\n          >\n          and F<sub>GC</sub>\n          create zero moment about C.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Such Method of Sections is very quick. As a comparison, if the method of joints were used to determine, say, the force in member GC, it\n          would be necessary to analyze joints A, B, and G in sequence, which is more tedious.\n

Internal loadings can be determined by using the method of sections. To illustrate this method, this module will show you\n      how to determine the internal loadings.\n    </p>\n    <p><b>Normal force</b>: The force component that acts perpendicular to the cross section.</p>\n    <p><b>Shear force</b>: The force component that is tangent to the cross section.</p>\n    <p><b>Bending moment</b>: The couple moment within the section.</p>\n    <p>\n      The force components prevent the relative translation between the two segments, and the couple moment prevents the relative rotation. According\n      to Newton's third law, these loadings must act in opposite directions on each segment.\n    </p>\n    <intforc ref=\"foo\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n//import truss from \"../../utils/methods_of_sections/truss\";\n//import cutSections from \"../../utils/methods_of_sections/cutSections\";\n//import Fbc from \"../../utils/methods_of_sections/Fbc\";\n//import Fgc from \"../../utils/methods_of_sections/Fgc\";\n//import Fgf from \"../../utils/methods_of_sections/Fgf\";\nimport int_forc from \"../../utils/Internal_Forces/internal_forces_1.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return { currentSelection: 0 };\n  },\n  components: {\n    intforc: int_forc\n    //truss: truss,\n    //cutSections: cutSections,\n    //Fbc: Fbc,\n    //Fgc: Fgc,\n    //Fgf: Fgf\n  }\n  //   methods: {\n  //     changeSelection(nextState) {\n  //       this.currentSelection = nextState;\n  //       this.$refs.foo.changeState(nextState);\n  //       // console.log(nextState);\n  //     }\n  //   },\n  //   mounted() {\n  //     // let c1 = document.querySelector(\".column1\");\n  //     // let c2 = document.querySelector(\".column2\");\n  //     // let p = c2.parentElement;\n  //     // c1.clientWidth = p.clientWidth - c2.clientWidth;\n  //   }\n};\nexport const meta = {\n  title: \"Internal Forces of Beam 1\",\n  description: \"\",\n  number: 24\n};\n</script>\n\n<style>\np {\n  font-size: 16;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./InternalForces1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./InternalForces1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./InternalForces1.vue?vue&type=template&id=7689cffb&\"\nimport script from \"./InternalForces1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./InternalForces1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./InternalForces1.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./methods_of_sections.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./methods_of_sections.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\""],"sourceRoot":""}
