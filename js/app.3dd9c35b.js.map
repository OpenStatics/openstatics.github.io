The adding process is shown below.<br /><br />\n\n    From this construction, we can apply the law of cosines or the law of sines to the triangle in order to obtain the magnitude of the resultant\n    force and its direction. We know that |<i>&Theta;</i><sub>1</sub> - <i>&Theta;</i><sub>2</sub>| = &alpha; + &beta; = &pi; - &gamma;, thus we have\n    &gamma; = &pi; - |<i>&Theta;</i><sub>1</sub> - <i>&Theta;</i><sub>2</sub>|. Using law of cosines we know the magnitude of resultant force will be\n    <br /><br />\n\n    <vue-mathjax :formula=\"eq1\" />\n    Thus, we get the magnitude <vue-mathjax formula=\"(F_R\\\\)\" />. While for direction, we first get the angles <vue-mathjax formula=\"(\\\\\\alpha\\\\)\" />,\n    <vue-mathjax formula=\"(\\\\\\beta\\\\)\" /> by the law of sines, <br />\n    <vue-mathjax :formula=\"eq2\" />\n\n    Once we get <vue-mathjax formula=\"(\\\\\\alpha\\\\)\" />, <vue-mathjax formula=\"(\\\\\\beta\\\\)\" />, we can get the magnitude direction\n    <vue-mathjax formula=\"(\\\\\\theta\\\\)\" /> by the geometry:\n    <vue-mathjax :formula=\"eq3\" />\n\n    Thus we know the magnitude as well as direction of the resultant force <vue-mathjax formula=\"(\\vec{F_R}\\\\)\" />.\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      eq1: `\\\\begin{align}\n      \\\\vec{F}_R &= \\\\sqrt{F_1^2

class=\"text-danger text-center my-4\">Method of Sections</h1>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col\">\n        <p>\n          When we need to find the force in only a few members of a truss, we can analyze the truss using the method of sections. It is based on the\n          principle that if the truss is in equilibrium then any segment of the truss is also in equilibrium. Since we only have three independent\n          equilibrium equations, i.e. 2 force components equilibrium + 1 moment equilibrium, or 1 force components equilibrium + 2 moment equilibrium,\n          we should try to choose section passes that cut through no more than 3 members. Always assume that the unknown member forces at the cut\n          section are tensile forces, i.e., \"pulling\" on the member. By doing this, the numerical solution of the equilibrium equations will yield\n          positive scalars for members in tension and negative scalars for members in compression.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We pick an example from Chapter 6.4 of Hibbler's Mechanics of Materials, 10th edition to show the process in detail. During the solution, we\n          should carefully consider ways of writing the equations so as to yield a direct solution for each of the unknowns, rather than having to\n          solve simultaneous equations. So, in this example, we first sum moments about G to yield a direct solution for F<sub>BC</sub>, since F<sub\n            >GC</sub\n          >\n          and F<sub>GF</sub> create zero moment about G. Then F<sub>GC</sub> can be found directly by the force summation in y direction since F<sub\n            >BC</sub\n          >\n          and F<sub>GF</sub> have no components in y direction. Finally, by summing moments about C we get F<sub>GF</sub> directly since F<sub\n            >BC</sub\n          >\n          and F<sub>GC</sub>\n          create zero moment about C.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Such Method of Sections is very quick. As a comparison, if the method of joints were used to determine, say, the force in member GC, it\n          would be necessary to analyze joints A, B, and G in sequence, which is more tedious.\n
