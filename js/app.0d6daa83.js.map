Since the resultant force is zero, the only effect of a couple is to produce an actual rotation, or if no movement is possible, there is a\n      tendency of rotation in a specified direction.

the animation of \"Moving a Force to Another Point\", aiming to give a more clear view about how the moment change during the\n      moving process.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In the following modulus, initially we have a force <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}$\" /> acting on point A, thus the moment it produces w.r.t.\n      point B will be <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{M}_{B0}=(\\vec{r}_A - \\vec{r}_B) \\times \\vec{F}$\" />.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      When we move <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}$\" /> from point A to point B along the line AB, say, we reach a point C located at line AB. Since\n      the magnitude of <vue-mathjax formula=\"$(\\vec{r}_C - \\vec{r}_B)$\" /> is less than that of\n      <vue-mathjax formula=\"$(\\vec{r}_A - \\vec{r}_B)$\" /> while it has the same direction, thus the magnitude of\n      <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{M}_B$\" /> decreases while its direction remains the same, we have\n      <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{M}_{B}=(\\vec{r}_C - \\vec{r}_B) \\times \\vec{F}$\" />. Meanwhile, the couple moment at C increases, from 0 ( at initial\n      point A ) to the <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{M}_{C}=(\\vec{r}_A - \\vec{r}_C) \\times \\vec{F}$\" /> (at point C), the value of which can be gotten\n      through the process in the previous modulus, i.e. \"Moving a Force to Another Point\". When <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}$\" /> reaches point B,\n      or we can say C coincides with B, then the couple moment becomes <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{M}_{C}=(\\vec{r}_A - \\vec{r}_B) \\times \\vec{F}$\" />,\n      which is the same as <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{M}_{B0}$\" />. Through this moving process, we can clearly see how the couple moment\n      <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{M}_C$\" /> increases and finally equals\n      <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{M}_{B0}$\" />\n    </p>\n    <moving />\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport moving_force from \"../../utils/MovingForcePoint/moving_force_point_anim.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {};\n  },\n  components: {\n    moving: moving_force\n  }\n};\nexport const meta = {\n  title: \"Moving a Force to a Point - Animation\",\n  description: \"\",\n  number: 14\n};\n</script>\n\n<style>\np {\n  font-size: 16;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./MovingForcePointAnim.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./MovingForcePointAnim.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./MovingForcePointAnim.vue?vue&type=template&id=c5aae4c6&\"\nimport script from \"./MovingForcePointAnim.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./MovingForcePointAnim.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./MovingForcePointAnim.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"container-fluid\"},[_c('h1',{staticClass:\"text-danger text-center my-4\"},[_vm._v(\"Internal Forces of Beam 2\")]),_c('p',{staticClass:\"text-center\"},[_vm._v(\"\\n    Based on the problem 7-7 of R.

reduce a system of forces and couple moments acting on a body to a simpler form by replacing it with an equivalent\n      system, consisting of a single resultant force acting at a specific point and a resultant couple moment. A system is equivalent if the external\n      effects it produces on a body are the same as those caused by the original force and couple moment system. In this context, the external effects\n      of a system refer to the translating and rotating motion of the body if the body is free to move, or it refers to the reactive forces at the\n      supports if the body is held fixed.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The key point of such reduction is how to move a force to a given point equivalently. The following case shows the procedure of such moving.\n      <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}_A$\" /> is applied at point A, and we want to move it to point B without disturbing the overall equilibrium. So,\n      we add two forces at point B, they are both parallel with <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}_A$\" /> but have the same magnitude of\n      <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}_A$\" />, but one has the same direction as <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}_A$\" /> and the other has the opposite\n      direction as <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}_A$\" />. Here, we denote them as <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}_{B+}$\" /> and\n      <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}_{B-}$\" /> separately. Now, since <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}_A$\" /> and\n      <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}_{B-}$\" /> make up a couple moment <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{M}$\" />, they can be replaced with\n      <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}_M$\" />. Thus, the system can be replaced by a force acting at B which is\n      <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}_{B+}$\" />, together with a couple moment <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{M}$\" /> which is a free vector.\n      <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}_{B+}$\" /> and <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{M}$\" /> are determined by\n    </p>\n\n    <div class=\"text-center\">\n      <p><vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}_{B+} = \\vec{F}_A, \\vec{M} = (\\vec{r}_A - \\vec{r}_B) \\times \\vec{F}_A$\" /></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>\n      By doing this, we can move a force to any given point without disturbing the overall equilibrium since the total force and the total moment\n      produced by the force about any point remain the same. Suppose we have several forces acting on several points, we can use same process to move\n      these forces to an given point equivalently, and then get one resultant force and one resultant couple moment for all the forces acting at this\n      point as well as those couple moments, thus simplifying the system.\n    </p>\n    <moving />\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport moving_force from \"../../utils/MovingForcePoint/moving_force_point.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {};\n  },\n  components: {\n    moving: moving_force\n  }\n};\nexport const meta = {\n  title: \"Moving a Force to a Point\",\n  description: \"\",\n  number: 13\n};\n</script>\n\n<style>\np {\n  font-size: 16;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./MovingForcePoint.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./MovingForcePoint.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./MovingForcePoint.vue?vue&type=template&id=7b9df0b6&\"\nimport script from \"./MovingForcePoint.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./MovingForcePoint.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./MovingForcePoint.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ForceVector3D.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ForceVector3D.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./InternalForces1.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./InternalForces1.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"container-fluid\"},[_c('h1',{staticClass:\"text-danger text-center my-4\"},[_vm._v(\"Moment of a Force 2D\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"\\n    The moment of a force \"),_c('vue-mathjax',{attrs:{\"formula\":\"$\\\\vec{F}$\"}}),_vm._v(\" about point O, or actually about the moment axis passing through O and perpendicular\\n    to the plane containing O and \"),_c('vue-mathjax',{attrs:{\"formula\":\"$\\\\vec{F}$\"}}),_vm._v(\", can be expressed using the vector cross product, namely\\n    \"),_c('vue-mathjax',{attrs:{\"formula\":\"$\\\\vec{M}_O = \\\\vec{r} \\\\times \\\\vec{F}$\"}}),_vm._v(\".

formula=\"$\\vec{F}$\" /> about point O, or actually about the moment axis passing through O and perpendicular\n      to the plane containing O and <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}$\" />, can be expressed using the vector cross product, namely\n      <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{M}_O = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}$\" />. Here <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{r}$\" /> represents a position vector directed\n      from O to any point on the line of action of <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}$\" />.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For a beam with unbalanced moment <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{M}_O$\" />, the equation of motion is described by\n      <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{M}_O = I_O \\vec{\\ddot{\\theta}}$\" />, where <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{\\ddot{\\theta}}$\" /> is the angular\n      acceleration, <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{I_O}$\" /> is the moment of inertia with respect to O. If the beam is constrained to be rotate within\n      certain plane, the equation of motion is simplified as <vue-mathjax formula=\"$M_O = I_0 \\ddot{\\theta}$\" />. So we see, in order to keep the beam\n      in static, we need to make the <vue-mathjax formula=\"$M_O$\" /> to zero.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For the following problem, we have two forces <vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}_1$\" />,<vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{F}_2$\" />, with their\n      magnitudes, directions and acting positions to be set. Both of them produce the moment with respect to hinge, and the resultant may cause the\n      moment to rotate with respect to hinge. We can see the rotation once we set unbalanced moment of these two forces. Also, we can see that the\n      beam will keep in static once the resultant moment is zero.\n    </p>\n\n    <!-- <div class=\"text-center\">\n      <p><vue-mathjax formula=\"$\\vec{r}$\" /></p>\n    </div> -->\n    <mf />\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport moment_of_force from \"../../utils/MomentOfForce/moment_of_force_2D.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {};\n  },\n  components: {\n    mf: moment_of_force\n  }\n};\nexport const meta = {\n  title: \"Moment of Force 2D\",\n  description: \"\",\n  number: 9\n};\n</script>\n\n<style>\np {\n  font-size: 16;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./MomentForce2D.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\";

class=\"text-danger text-center my-4\">Method of Sections</h1>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col\">\n        <p>\n          When we need to find the force in only a few members of a truss, we can analyze the truss using the method of sections. It is based on the\n          principle that if the truss is in equilibrium then any segment of the truss is also in equilibrium. Since we only have three independent\n          equilibrium equations, i.e. 2 force components equilibrium + 1 moment equilibrium, or 1 force components equilibrium + 2 moment equilibrium,\n          we should try to choose section passes that cut through no more than 3 members. Always assume that the unknown member forces at the cut\n          section are tensile forces, i.e., \"pulling\" on the member. By doing this, the numerical solution of the equilibrium equations will yield\n          positive scalars for members in tension and negative scalars for members in compression.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We pick an example from Chapter 6.4 of Hibbler's Mechanics of Materials, 10th edition to show the process in detail. During the solution, we\n          should carefully consider ways of writing the equations so as to yield a direct solution for each of the unknowns, rather than having to\n          solve simultaneous equations. So, in this example, we first sum moments about G to yield a direct solution for F<sub>BC</sub>, since F<sub\n            >GC</sub\n          >\n          and F<sub>GF</sub> create zero moment about G. Then F<sub>GC</sub> can be found directly by the force summation in y direction since F<sub\n            >BC</sub\n          >\n          and F<sub>GF</sub> have no components in y direction. Finally, by summing moments about C we get F<sub>GF</sub> directly since F<sub\n            >BC</sub\n          >\n          and F<sub>GC</sub>\n          create zero moment about C.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Such Method of Sections is very quick. As a comparison, if the method of joints were used to determine, say, the force in member GC, it\n          would be necessary to analyze joints A, B, and G in sequence, which is more tedious.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col\">\n        <div class=\"row align-items-center\">\n          <div class=\"col\">\n            <button class=\"btn btn-primary mx-3\" :class=\"{ 'btn-warning': currentSelection === 0 }\" @click=\"() => changeSelection(0)\">\n              Overview\n            </button>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"col\">\n            <button class=\"btn btn-primary mx-3\" :class=\"{ 'btn-warning': currentSelection === 1 }\" @click=\"() => changeSelection(1)\">Section</button>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"col\">\n            <button class=\"btn btn-primary mx-3\" :class=\"{ 'btn-warning': currentSelection === 2 }\" @click=\"() => changeSelection(2)\">\n              F<sub>BC</sub>\n            </button>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"col\">\n            <button class=\"btn btn-primary mx-3\" :class=\"{ 'btn-warning': currentSelection === 3 }\" @click=\"() => changeSelection(3)\">\n              F<sub>GC</sub>\n            </button>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"col\">\n            <button class=\"btn btn-primary mx-3\" :class=\"{ 'btn-warning': currentSelection === 4 }\" @click=\"() => changeSelection(4)\">\n              F<sub>GF</sub>\n            </button>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"row\">\n          <methOfSec ref=\"foo\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n//import truss from \"../../utils/methods_of_sections/truss\";\n//import cutSections from \"../../utils/methods_of_sections/cutSections\";\n//import Fbc from \"../../utils/methods_of_sections/Fbc\";\n//import Fgc from \"../../utils/methods_of_sections/Fgc\";\n//import Fgf from \"../../utils/methods_of_sections/Fgf\";\nimport meth_of_sec from \"../../utils/methods_of_sections/meth_of_sec\";\n\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return { currentSelection: 0 };\n  },\n  components: {\n    methOfSec: meth_of_sec\n    //truss: truss,\n    //cutSections: cutSections,\n    //Fbc: Fbc,\n    //Fgc: Fgc,\n    //Fgf: Fgf\n  },\n  methods: {\n    changeSelection(nextState) {\n      this.currentSelection = nextState;\n      this.$refs.foo.change_state(nextState);\n      console.log(nextState);\n    }\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    // let c1 = document.querySelector(\".column1\");\n    // let c2 = document.querySelector(\".column2\");\n    // let p = c2.parentElement;\n    // c1.clientWidth = p.clientWidth - c2.clientWidth;\n  }\n};\nexport const meta = {\n  title: \"Methods of sections\",\n  description: \"\",\n  number: 22\n};\n</script>\n\n<style>\np {\n  font-size: 16;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./methods_of_sections.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\";
