The adding process is shown below.<br /><br />\n\n    From this construction, we can apply the law of cosines or the law of sines to the triangle in order to obtain the magnitude of the resultant\n    force and its direction. We know that |<i>&Theta;</i><sub>1</sub> - <i>&Theta;</i><sub>2</sub>| = &alpha; + &beta; = &pi; - &gamma;, thus we have\n    &gamma; = &pi; - |<i>&Theta;</i><sub>1</sub> - <i>&Theta;</i><sub>2</sub>|. Using law of cosines we know the magnitude of resultant force will be\n    <br /><br />\n\n    \\[\\vec{F}_R = \\sqrt{F_1^2 +F_2^2-2F_1F_2cos\\gamma}\\] \\[=\\sqrt{F_1^2 +F_2^2-2F_1F_2cos(\\pi - |\\theta_1 - \\theta_2|)}\\]\n    \\[=\\sqrt{F_1^2+F_2^2+2F_1F_2cos(\\theta_1-\\theta_2)}\\] Thus, we get the magnitude \\(F_R\\). While for direction, we first get the angles \\(\\alpha\\),\n    \\(\\beta\\) by the law of sines, <br />\n    \\[\\frac{F_1}{sin \\alpha} = \\frac{F_2}{sin \\beta} = \\frac{F_R}{sin \\gamma}\\] \\[\\Rightarrow \\alpha = sin^{-1}(\\frac{F_1}{F_R}sin\\gamma), \\beta =\n    sin^{-1}(\\frac{F_2}{F_R}sin\\gamma)\\] Once we get \\(\\alpha\\),\\(\\beta\\), we can get the magnitude direction \\(\\theta\\) by the geometry: \\[ \\theta=\n    \\begin{cases} \\theta_1 + \\beta ,& \\text{if } \\theta_1 \\lt \\theta_2\\\\ \\theta_2 + \\alpha ,& \\text{if } \\theta_1 \\geq \\theta_2 \\end{cases} \\] Thus we\n    know the magnitude as well as direction of the resultant force \\(\\vec{F}_R\\).\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n};\n</script>\n","import mod from

using the method of joints, which involves doing force balances around one joint at a time. 1. Select \\\"reaction\\n  forces\\\" to see how the reaction forces Subscript[R, A] and Subscript[R, E] are calculated. 2. Then, under the drop-down menu, select \\\"calculate\\n  moment\\\" to see the moment balance around joint A and calculate the reaction force at joint E. Move the mouse over the equations to see an\\n  explanation of the moment balance. 3. Next, select \\\"x-force balance\\\" to do a force balance in the x-direction at joint A. Note that joint A is\\n  fixed but joint E can move in the x-direction. 4. Select \\\"y-force balance\\\" to determine the reaction force at joint A. 5. Select \\\"balances at\\n  joints\\\" and select joint A. Check \\\"focus on joint\\\" to zoom in on the members around the joint and display the force balances. Note that the\\n  direction of the arrows are drawn in \\\"focus on joint\\\" because we know the correct direction. If the arrows were drawn assuming all members were\\n  under tension, then a negative force would result, indicating the direction should be reversed. 6. Repeat step 5 for the other joints. 7. When\\n  \\\"solved\\\" is selected from the joints, the compression (green) and tension (red) forces are shown on the full diagram. Arrows that point outward\\n  represent the member's response to compression forces, which act to shorten the member. Arrows that point inward represent the member's response\\n  to tension forces, which act to lengthen the member. When doing balances around the joints, the signs on all of the forces are positive because we\\n  assume we can determine which members are under tension and which are under compression before solving the truss.

Select \"reaction\n    forces\" to see how the reaction forces Subscript[R, A] and Subscript[R, E] are calculated. 2. Then, under the drop-down menu, select \"calculate\n    moment\" to see the moment balance around joint A and calculate the reaction force at joint E. Move the mouse over the equations to see an\n    explanation of the moment balance. 3. Next, select \"x-force balance\" to do a force balance in the x-direction at joint A. Note that joint A is\n    fixed but joint E can move in the x-direction. 4. Select \"y-force balance\" to determine the reaction force at joint A. 5. Select \"balances at\n    joints\" and select joint A. Check \"focus on joint\" to zoom in on the members around the joint and display the force balances. Note that the\n    direction of the arrows are drawn in \"focus on joint\" because we know the correct direction. If the arrows were drawn assuming all members were\n    under tension, then a negative force would result, indicating the direction should be reversed. 6. Repeat step 5 for the other joints. 7. When\n    \"solved\" is selected from the joints, the compression (green) and tension (red) forces are shown on the full diagram. Arrows that point outward\n    represent the member's response to compression forces, which act to shorten the member. Arrows that point inward represent the member's response\n    to tension forces, which act to lengthen the member. When doing balances around the joints, the signs on all of the forces are positive because we\n    assume we can determine which members are under tension and which are under compression before solving the truss. This is done by starting at\n    joint A, seeing that the reaction force points upward and knowing that the member force must point downward for the truss to remain stationary.\n

class=\"text-danger text-center my-4\">Method of Sections</h1>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col\">\n        <p>\n          When we need to find the force in only a few members of a truss, we can analyze the truss using the method of sections. It is based on the\n          principle that if the truss is in equilibrium then any segment of the truss is also in equilibrium. Since we only have three independent\n          equilibrium equations, i.e. 2 force components equilibrium + 1 moment equilibrium, or 1 force components equilibrium + 2 moment equilibrium,\n          we should try to choose section passes that cut through no more than 3 members. Always assume that the unknown member forces at the cut\n          section are tensile forces, i.e., \"pulling\" on the member. By doing this, the numerical solution of the equilibrium equations will yield\n          positive scalars for members in tension and negative scalars for members in compression.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We pick an example from Chapter 6.4 of Hibbler's Mechanics of Materials, 10th edition to show the process in detail. During the solution, we\n          should carefully consider ways of writing the equations so as to yield a direct solution for each of the unknowns, rather than having to\n          solve simultaneous equations. So, in this example, we first sum moments about G to yield a direct solution for F<sub>BC</sub>, since F<sub\n            >GC</sub\n          >\n          and F<sub>GF</sub> create zero moment about G. Then F<sub>GC</sub> can be found directly by the force summation in y direction since F<sub\n            >BC</sub\n          >\n          and F<sub>GF</sub> have no components in y direction. Finally, by summing moments about C we get F<sub>GF</sub> directly since F<sub\n            >BC</sub\n          >\n          and F<sub>GC</sub>\n          create zero moment about C.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Such Method of Sections is very quick. As a comparison, if the method of joints were used to determine, say, the force in member GC, it\n          would be necessary to analyze joints A, B, and G in sequence, which is more tedious.\n
